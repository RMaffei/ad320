Book Search using the Gutendex API

Goal: Fetch data from Project Gutenberg Books Library

Setting Up: 

1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Open ‘index.html’ in a web browser *OR* visit https://www.raemaffei.com/ad320/bookSearch/index.html 
3.	Use the search bar to enter a term and then select a sort option.
4.	Click ‘Search’ to fetch results based on options and search term.

Functionality:

This application allows users to search for books using a search term and sort them by popularity or subject. It utilizes the Gutendex API and displays it in a simple interface with condensed details. 

API Choice:

I chose Gutendex because it had a massive collection, and it was extremely easy to use. They already had sort options and I specifically like the popularity/ranking information to make it easier to search for relevant books. 

Challenges:

At first, I ran into errors with updating results based on changes to the search and sort queries. I also made sure to include extra data validation in order to get the proper results. 

Examples:

Search “The Odyssey” by Popularity, “History” by Subject, or “Charles Dickens” by Popularity to learn more about a specific title, subject, or famous works by an author.
