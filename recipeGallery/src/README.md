Recipe Gallery

Overview:

Creating this recipe gallery was an opportunity to dive into list rendering, component composition, and static data rendering. I was able to structure the components to display a list of data and curate a collection of recipes. I also made sure to create a layout that would be responsive and organize the recipe cards for easier viewing. This was a great application of foundational React concepts and simple responsive design techniques. 
How to Run: 

1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Run ‘npm start’ once located in folder’s directory.
3.	View the available recipes and add more in ‘recipes.js’.
