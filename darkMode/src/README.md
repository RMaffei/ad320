Feature Toggle Component “Dark Mode”

Overview:

This project served a great introduction to conditional rendering and creating components that use props to render content based on user interaction/conditions. This also serves as a lesson in state management and helped me grasp the concept of reusing components and how they can be integrated into applications to interact with features.  

How to Run: 

1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Run ‘npm start’ once located in folder’s directory.
