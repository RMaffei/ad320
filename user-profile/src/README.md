User Profile: Nested States

This project is a responsive React application that manages and updates user information to be displayed in real-time. It leverages React’s robust state management abilities and allows users to update profile details, including a nested address section. The updates are handled immutably, and this maintains the integrity of the data and gives instant feedback in the displayed output.
