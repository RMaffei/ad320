TypeScript Decorators

This project is a simple example of a wiki type page using decorators to enhance class behaviors and log method calls. Certain properties can be changed, and some are read only and only possible using accessor decorators. The page displays simple information about a person and uses class, method, and accessor decorators. 

How to Run:

1.	Download or clone files from repository.
2.	Run ‘npm install’.
3.	Run ‘npm run build’ after installing dependencies.
4.	Run ‘npm start’ and the results will display in the terminal.
