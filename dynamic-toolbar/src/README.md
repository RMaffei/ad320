Dynamic Alert Buttons

Overview:

Extending onto the custom alert button project, this component assignment had me creating a flexible toolbar with dynamic buttons. They have different alert messages when clicked and have been modified to accept message props, and a children prop to ensure the text can be dynamically set. The toolbar was then upgraded to render a list of AlertButton components based on the array’s properties. The buttons can be customized and trigger their own unique alerts and put in perspective the process of creating UI components within React.

How to Run: 

1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Download src files and project dependencies.
3.	Run ‘npm start’ in project directory. 
4.	Click buttons and observe unique behaviors within App.js.
