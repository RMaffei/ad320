Static Product List in React

Overview:

Practical exercise in creating components that render an array of products, using JSX syntax, and data management with React. I defined a dataset of products with information regarding description, price, etc. and displayed it in a responsive layout with placeholder images. This provides a foundation for making dynamic web applications and rendering components in a modular way. 

How to Run: 


1.	Clone or download project files from GitHub repository.
2.	Run ‘npm start’ once located in folder’s directory.
3.	Displays all product items, description, cost, etc. in browser.
