Increment Counter

Overview:

This is a simple React application that demonstrates state management and state updates by allowing users to increment the count on screen by 1, with an interval delay, and with an increment of 2. There are state updater functions that update the count as well as hooks, which demonstrate how React batches updates during asynchronous functions. This demonstration was a great practice in managing re-renders in a React application. 

How to Run:
