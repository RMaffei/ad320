Dog API: TanStack Query

This project gave me an opportunity to improve on a FetchAPI dog information app that was created a few weeks back. This variation is a React application that utilizes the TanStack Query to retrieve data from the Dog API. I started with a Vite + React + TypeScript shell and updated previous code to leverage TanStack. It provides details about various dog breeds, including a random fact and the corresponding dog group the breed belongs to. 

How to Run:

1.	Clone or download the repository
2.	Navigate to the /dog-app directory within terminal
3.	Run ‘npm install’ to install dependencies in that directory
4.	Run ‘npm run dev’ and view the app in your browser. Could be either http://localhost:5173/ or http://localhost:3000.
